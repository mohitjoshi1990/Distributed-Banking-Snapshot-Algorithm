# Distributed Banking Snapshot Algorithm
A Distributed Banking Application
You will first implement a distributed banking application. The distributed bank has multiple branches. Every
branch knows about all other branches. TCP connections are setup between all pairs of branches. Each branch
starts with an initial balance. The branch then randomly selects another destination branch and sends a random
amount of money to this destination branch at unpredictable times.
Each branch must handle the following two types of messages in a distributed bank:

InitBranch this messages contains two pieces of information: the initial balance of a branch and a list of all
branches (including itself) in the distributed bank. Upon receiving this message, a branch will set its initial
balance and record the list of all branches.

Transfer this message indicates that a remote, source branch is transferring money to the current, target branch.
The message contains an integer representing the amount of money being transferred and the remote, source
branch’s name. The branch receiving the message should increase its balance by the amount of money
indicated in the message.

Every branch is both a sender and a receiver. A sender can only send positive amount of money. It needs to
first decrease its balance, then send out a message containing the amount of money to a remote branch. A branch’s
balance should not become negative. For simplicity, the amount of money should be drawn randomly between 1%
and 5% of the branch’s initial balance and can only be an integer. Intervals between consecutive sending operations
should be drawn uniformly at random between 0 and 5 seconds.
If you choose to implement the sender and receiver in different threads, you have to protect the balance of your
branch using a mutex or another synchronization method. In addition, you can assume that neither the branches
nor the communication channels will fail.

Your branch executable should take two command line inputs. The first one is a human-readable name of the
branch, e.g., “branch1”. The second one specifies the port number the branch runs on.
$> ./branch branch1 9090
It is expected that your branch executable will start a new branch called “branch1” which listens on port 9090 for
incoming TCP connections.


2.1 Controller
In this assignment, we rely on a controller to set a branch’s initial balance and notify every branch of all branches in
the distributed bank. This controller takes two command line inputs: the total amount of money in the distributed
bank and a local file that stores the names, IP addresses, and port numbers of all branches.
An example of how the controller program should operate is provided below:

$> ./controller 4000 branches.txt
The file (branches.txt) should contain a list of names, IP addresses, and ports, in the format “<name>
<public-ip-address> <port>”, of all of the running branches.
For example, if four branches with names: “branch1”, “branch2”, “branch3”, and “branch4” are running on
remote01.cs.binghamton.edu port 9090, 9091, 9092, and 9093, then branches.txt should contain:
branch1 128.226.180.163 9090
branch2 128.226.180.163 9091
branch3 128.226.180.163 9092
branch4 128.226.180.163 9093

The controller will distribute the total amount of money evenly among all branches, e.g., in the example above,
every branch will receive $1,000 initial balance. The controller initiates all branches by individually calling the
initBranch method described above. Note that the initial balance must be integer.

3 Taking Global Snapshots of the Bank
In this part, you will use the Chandy-Lamport global snapshot algorithm take global snapshots of your bank. In
case of the distributed bank, a global snapshot will contain both the local state of each branch (i.e., its balance) and
the amount of money in transit on all communication channels. Each branch will be responsible for recording and
reporting its own local state (balance) as well as the total money in transit on each of its incoming channels.

  For simplicity, in this assignment, the controller will contact one of the branches to initiate the global
snapshot. It does so by sending a message indicating the InitSnapshot operation to the selected branch. The
selected branch will then initiate the snapshot by first recording its own local state and send out Marker messages
to all other branches. After some time (long enough for the snapshot algorithm to finish), the controller sends
RetrieveSnapshot messages to all branches to retrieve their recorded local and channel states.


If the snapshot is correct, the total amount of money in all branches and in transit should equal to the
command line argument given to the controller.
Each branch needs to support the following four types of messages to add snapshot capability to your distributed
bank.

  InitSnapshot upon receiving this message, a branch records its own local state (balance) and sends out Marker
messages to all other branches. To identify multiple snapshots, the controller includes a snapshot_id to
this initSnapshot message, and all the Marker messages should include this snapshot_id as well.

  Marker every Marker message includes a snapshot_id and the sending branch’s name branch_name. Upon
receiving this message, the receiving branch does the following:
     1. If this is the first Marker message with the snapshot_id the receiving branch has seen, the receiving
    branch records its own local state (balance), records the state of the incoming channel from
    the sender to itself as empty, immediately starts recording on other incoming channels, and sends out
    Marker messages to all of its outgoing channels (i.e., all branches except itself).
    Note that to ensure the correctness of the algorithm, it is important that no Transfer messages can
    be sent out until all the necessary Marker messages have been sent out.

    2. Otherwise, the receiving branch records the state of the incoming channel as the sequence of money
    transfers that arrived between when it recorded its local state and when it received the Marker.

  RetrieveSnapshot the controller sends retrieveSnapshot messages to all branches to collect snapshots. This message
will contain the snapshot_id that uniquely identifies a snapshot. A receiving branch should its
recorded local and channel states and return them to the caller (i.e., the controller) by sending a returnSnapshot
message (next).

  ReturnSnapshot a branch returns the controller its captured local snapshot in this message. This message should
include the snapshot_id, captured local state, as well as all incoming channel states.

  The controller should be fully automated. It periodically sends the InitSnapshot message with monotonically
increasing snapshot_id on a randomly selected branch and outputs to the console the aggregated
global snapshot retrieved from all branches in the correct format. In addition, the snapshot taken by branches
needs to be identified by their names: e.g., “branch1” to represent branch1’s local state, and “branch2->branch1”
to represent the channel state. Here is an example controller output:

snapshot_id: 10
branch1: 1000, branch2->branch1: 10, branch3->branch1: 0
branch2: 1000, branch1->branch2: 0, branch3->branch2: 15
branch3: 960, branch->branch3: 15, branch2->branch3: 0
  
3.1 FIFO message delivery
  The correctness of the Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm relies on FIFO message delivery of all communication
channels among all branches (processes). A communication channel is a one way connection between two
branches. For example, in this assignment, from “branch1” to “branch2” is one communication channel. From
“branch2” to “branch1” is another channel.

  In order to ensure FIFO message delivery, in this assignment, we use TCP as the transport layer protocol for
branch communications – both banking messages described in Part 2 and snap-shot related messages described
in Part 3. TCP ensures reliability and FIFO message delivery. Because TCP is full duplex, allowing messages to
transmit in both directions, there are two ways to setup branch communications:

    1. We can use TCP in the half duplex manner, setting up two TCP connections between every pair of
    branches. In this way, suppose there exists 4 branches, we will setup a total of 12 TCP connections, with
    each branch handling 3 incoming connections and 3 outgoing connections.
    If you choose to implement the assignment in this way, you need to make sure that you do not mix up the use
    of these connections. For example, if a connection is designated to be an incoming connection for branch1,
    then branch1 should never use this connection for sending outgoing messages. Otherwise, the FIFO nature
    of communication channels will be violated.

    2. Or, we can take advantage of the full duplex nature of TCP and have each branch should set up exactly one
    TCP connection with every other branches in the distributed bank. In this way, given 4 branches, we will
    set up a total of 6 TCP connections.

You can use either design. Bottom line is the FIFO property of communication channels can never be voilated.
